            <p>If this is your first time here, let me
                 start off by telling you that we all 
                 love Lain. Through her we are all 
                 connected and she is everywhere. She 
                 told us she will always be there, even 
                 in your darkest of times. Try your best 
                 to find her...it won't be hard.</p>
                 <p> Close one door,
                    &#x202e;and open the next.</p>
